DEMO 1:
- To find Demo1 in our repository, go to the demo1 branch and look through the files there. There is a file called 'Demo1.java'; this is
the file that is supposed to run the first demo.  All of the required classes are in the same branch.

- To run Demo1, you have to compile and then there are two requirements/arguments.  To compile 'Demo1.java', compile it with every other
file in the branch (ie; all of the required classes which are already in the branch). In the command line, you have to specify two
arguments in order for the program to run.  The first argument is the amount of lives we wish to set the avatar to have; the second is the 
amount of health the avatar has. So, the command line should look somehting like this after compiling 'Demo1.java':
      C:\Users\amman\Documents\CPSC 233\Group 15 Project>java Demo1 3 3

DEMO 2:
- To find demo 2 in our repository, go to the link https://github.com/Equailax/CD_Demise/tree/demo2 or go directly to our CD_Demise 
repository and switch to the branch "demo2" and download all the files by clicking the button labelled "Clone or download" then clicking
"Download ZIP" and extracting all the files into a folder.

- To run demo 2, you have to compile all the files extracted from the demo2 branch zip. Open up your terminal and navigate to the folder
containing the files extracted from the zip file earlier then compile all of the files inside. After compiling all of the files, type 
"java GUIAnimaionApp" into your terminal to bring up the GUI window. In order to interact with the GUI and move the avatar you have use 
arrow keys. Up arrow key to move up, left Arrow key to move left, down arrow key to move down and right arrow key to move right.
