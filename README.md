DEMO 1:
- To find Demo1 in our repository, go to the demo1 branch and look through the files there. There is a file called 'Demo1.java'; this is
the file that is supposed to run the first demo.  All of the required classes are in the same branch.

- To run Demo1, you have to compile and then there are two requirements/arguments.  To compile 'Demo1.java', compile it with every other
file in the branch (ie; all of the required classes which are already in the branch). In the command line, you have to specify two
arguments in order for the program to run.  The first argument is the amount of lives we wish to set the avatar to have; the second is the 
amount of health the avatar has. So, the command line should look somehting like this after compiling 'Demo1.java':
      C:\Users\amman\Documents\CPSC 233\Group 15 Project>java Demo1 3 3
